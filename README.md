# AI-News-Classifier

### An AI classifier for News Headlines

This is a web app that classifies news into 4 categories: Sports, Crime, Science, and Business using a machine learning model trained on a dataset of 40000 news articles.

The model was trained using the [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) Python library using a naive Bayes classifier.

The web app was deployed using Flask and Heroku.
